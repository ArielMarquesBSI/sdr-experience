 # Update all .grcs. A lot of GNU Radio Blocks were updated and moved to another category, it causes a lot of problems in our .grcs;
 # (DONE) Create a matlab script to simulate the algorithm and its use for sensing the FM spectrum. Generate a WFM signal;
 # (DONE) Create a python script to simulate the algorithm and its use for sensing the FM spectrum. Generate a WFM signal;
 # (DONE) Prepare MATLAB scripts for each one of the desired measures defined below.
 # (DONE) Define measures to be performed with the algorithm/dongle in order to plot all the results needed:
    * Pfa vs dbW, 
    * Pd vs SNR, 
    * Desired Pfa vs Achieved Pfa, 
    * Pfa vs Achieved Pd, 
    * Function Profiling, 
    * FFT Size vs SNR vs PD.
 # (DONE) Define output values to be provided by the spectrum sensing block: Pfa and Pd;
 # (DONE) What kind of metrics can we employ in our paper? The ones defined above.
 # (DONE) Add segments to check for each of the other FFT sizes;
 # Create a table with some Tcme values;
 # (CANCELED) Add one more output to the spectrum sensing block which outputs SNR;
 # Create a block which measures the SNR;
 # Carry out simulations with VSG and USB dongle; 
 # Write a paper with findings/results;
 # Re-check the GNU Radio simulation for FFT size 512 and 2048;
 # Create GNU Radio simulations varying Pd.
