#summary TODO.

= TODO List =
 # Update all .grcs. A lot of GNU Radio Blocks were updated and moved to another category, it causes a lot of problems in our .grcs;
 # Create a matlab script to simulate the algorithm and its use for sensing the FM spectrum. Generate a WFM signal;
 # Define measures to be performed with the algorithm/dongle in order to plot all the results needed, e.g. Pfa vs SNR, Pd vs SNR, Pfa desired vs Pfa obtained, etc.
 # Define output values to be provided by the spectrum sensing block;
 # What kind of metrics can we employ in our paper?
