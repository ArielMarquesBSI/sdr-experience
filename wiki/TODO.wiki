#summary TODO.

= TODO List =
 # Update all .grcs. A lot of GNU Radio Blocks were updated and moved to another category, it causes a lot of problems in our .grcs;
 # (DONE) Create a matlab script to simulate the algorithm and its use for sensing the FM spectrum. Generate a WFM signal;
 # (DONE) Create a python script to simulate the algorithm and its use for sensing the FM spectrum. Generate a WFM signal;
 # Prepare MATLAB scripts for each one of the desired measures defined below.
 # Define measures to be performed with the algorithm/dongle in order to plot all the results needed:
    * Pfa vs dbW, 
    * Pd vs SNR, 
    * Desired Pfa vs Achieved Pfa, 
    * Pfa vs Achieved Pd, 
    * Function Profiling, 
    * FFT Size vs SNR vs PD.
 # Define output values to be provided by the spectrum sensing block;
 # What kind of metrics can we employ in our paper?
 # Create a table with some Tcme values;
 # Add one more output to the spectrum sensing block which outputs SNR;
 # Create a block which measures the SNR;
 # Carry out simulations with VSG and USB dongle;
